Introduction

This is a rom hack of Pokemon Emerald, built on top of the pokeemerald decompilosition repository, and the pokeemerald expansion repository. By far, the vast majority of the work on this game was done by:
- The team who developed the original Pokemon Emerald title.
- Those who worked on the decomposition of source code from the original Pokemon Emerald title.
- All of the individuals who have contributed to the vast array of updated content, quality of life features, configuration options and more for the expansion repository.

By comparison, my work on this was simply:
- To implement some fairly minor changes to Pokemon to suit my own personal preferences.
- To write and edit this new story.
- To update the map and NPCs to design the player journey through Hoenn on this new adventure.



Story Premise

The story of Topaz is a sequel to a dystopian continuation of the story in Pokemon Sapphire. Team Aqua were ultimately successful in their endeavors to awaken Kyogre, and caused a disastrous event. Kyogre started a relentless storm which massively raised sea levels in our world, and left much of the beloved Hoenn region submerged and destroyed. This also permenantly changed the climate, with far more rain, less sunlight and colder temperatures affecting the towns and routes

The flooding affected Kanto and Johto even more severely, so in the years that followed many familiar faces migrated away from the decimated double region, and took part in combined efforts to rebuild a new Hoenn on the lands that remained accessible.

Canonically, Topaz follows a playthrough of Pokemon Green, and a playthrough of Pokemon Gold*. Trainer Green became the Kanto champion with his Venusaur, defeating his rival Red and his Charizard. Trainer Kris later became Johto/Kanto champion with her* Feraligatr.

*(This canon is based on the story of Pokemon Gold, but based on the female protagonist who was only playable in Pokemon Crystal)

Trainer Brendan had aquired 6 Hoenn badges on his adventure with Blaziken before he failed to stop Team Aqua from executing their plan. Since that time Brendan has rarely been seen, and is generally believed to be in self exile, having blamed himself for the disaster.

Our Topaz story picks up ( ) years later, with Professor (May) Birch introducing us to the world of Pokemon. We start this adventure in our tiny island hometown of New Dewford, and May has three Pokemon for us and our rival to choose from: Treecko, Cyndaquil and Squirtle.



Pokemon

The Pokedex used in Topaz uses the National Pokedex order, but with any later released evolutions and pre-evolutions appearing alongside their earliest evolution family member appearance. This Pokedex is primarily based on the evolution families which were present in the generation 3 games, and on a normal play through, there are ( ) catchable Pokemon.

In general, I decided that this game would provide the best experience for players if Pokemon's stats and data were clearly based on a specific main series game. This way, easily accessible and established sources (eg. Serebii, Bulbapedia) can be used to get information relevant for Pokemon Topaz. To this end, I chose to base everything on Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire data.

This is not always the case however, for two reasons. The first reason is that there are Pokemon included in Topaz which first appeared in generation 7, 8 and 9. For these Pokemon, the correct information is that of the first generation in which they appeared. The second reason is that I wanted to make a selection of my own changes, which I feel provide marginal improvements to the game These changes are listed in TOPAZ_CHANGES.md
